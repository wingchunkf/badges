Obviously, I had quite a bit of trouble with this task due to decisions I made early on. I did not set the HTML up properly to allow for the 'flipping'
effect. I was unable to write JS that would display the icons upon clicking the 'points'.

If I were to do this over, I would determine how to do the 'flip' effect first, then create my html file. I also would have liked to use 'toggle' 
in the JS but went with a more simplistic method which resulted in more code than was necessary to create the functionality.
