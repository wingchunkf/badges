Obviously, I had quite a bit of trouble with this task due to decisions I made early on. I did not set the HTML up properly to allow for the 'flipping'
effect. I was unable to write JS that would display the icons upon clicking the 'points'.

The JS code that removes the icons and replaces them with the corresponding points from the JSON file has a bug somewhere, which resulted in unexpected behavior. The first 11 icons display expected behavior, but for the remaining icons, more than one icon is removed with one click.

If I were to do this over, I would determine how to do the 'flip' effect first, then create my html file. I also would have liked to use 'toggle' 
in the JS but went with a more simplistic method which resulted in more code than was necessary to create the functionality.
